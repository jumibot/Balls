# Balls

**English** | **[Español](README_ES.md)**

An educational Java project that demonstrates real-time 2D physics simulation through a dynamic bouncing balls environment with interactive gameplay elements. 

This project serves as a comprehensive learning platform for understanding software architecture patterns, concurrent programming, game engine fundamentals, and object-oriented design principles.

## What the Program Does

**Balls** is a real-time 2D physics simulation featuring dynamic entities (balls/asteroids) that interact within a configurable world space. The program creates an animated environment where:

- **Dynamic Bodies**: Entities move, rotate, and collide according to physics rules governed by interchangeable physics engines
- **Player Interaction**: Users can control a player entity with thrust, rotation, and firing capabilities using keyboard inputs
- **Multiple Physics Engines**: Choose from different physics implementations including basic physics, spin physics, and null physics for varied simulation behaviors
- **World Generation**: Procedurally generated worlds with customizable backgrounds, static bodies, and decorative elements
- **Weapon Systems**: Fire projectiles with configurable properties and behaviors
- **Life Generation**: Automated entity spawning system that maintains activity in the simulation
- **Visual Rendering**: Real-time graphics rendering using Java Swing with asset management for sprites and visual effects

The simulation runs continuously with a multithreaded architecture, separating rendering (View), game logic (Model), and user input handling (Controller) for optimal performance and maintainability.

## Educational Value for Learning Programming

This project serves as an excellent educational resource for learning fundamental and advanced programming concepts:

## Project Structure

The codebase is organized into well-defined packages, each with clear responsibilities:

### Core MVC Packages

- **`main`**: Application entry point that bootstraps the engine, wires dependencies, and starts the simulation
- **`model`**: Game state and simulation logic (entities, physics, weapons, events, actions)
  - **`model.entities`**: Entity implementations (DynamicBody, StaticBody, PlayerBody, AbstractEntity, DecoEntity)
  - **`model.physics`**: Physics engine implementations (BasicPhysicsEngine, SpinPhysicsEngine, NullPhysicsEngine, AbstractPhysicsEngine)
  - **`model.weapons`**: Weapon system implementations (BasicWeapon, WeaponDto)
- **`view`**: Presentation layer handling rendering and display (View, Renderer, ControlPanel)
  - **`view.renderables`**: Visual representation objects for entities (DBodyRenderable, EntityRenderable, EntityInfoDTO)
- **`controller`**: Mediator coordinating Model and View, processing user input and managing engine state

### Supporting Packages

- **`assets`**: Asset management system for loading and organizing visual resources (Assets, AssetCatalog, AssetInfo, AssetType)
- **`world`**: World definition and configuration (WorldDefinition, BackgroundDef, DynamicBodyDef, StaticBodyDef, DecoratorDef)
  - **`world.providers`**: Factory implementations for generating different world configurations (RandomWorldDefinitionProvider)
